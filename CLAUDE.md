# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Order Book — real-time trading order book. Users place buy/sell limit orders; a matching engine pairs them into trades atomically within Convex mutations.

## Stack

- **Backend**: Convex (reactive DB + serverless functions, TypeScript-only)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3 + shadcn/ui (configured via `components.json`)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **MCP**: `claude mcp add convex -- npx convex mcp start`

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Next.js dev server (turbopack)
npx convex dev           # Convex dev server (generates types in convex/_generated/)

npm test                 # vitest run (all unit tests)
npx vitest run tests/matching.test.ts   # single test file
npm run test:watch       # vitest watch mode

npm run test:e2e         # playwright (all E2E)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/place-order.spec.ts  # single E2E
```

## Architecture

The backend is entirely in `convex/`. No SQL, no ORM — all functions are TypeScript running inside the Convex runtime.

- `convex/schema.ts` — table definitions (orders, trades, users) with indexes
- `convex/orders.ts` — `placeOrder` mutation (inserts order + calls matching), `cancelOrder`, `getOrderBook` query
- `convex/matching.ts` — `matchOrder` helper function (not a Convex function, receives `MutationCtx`). Called inside `placeOrder` to keep placement + matching in a single ACID transaction.
- `convex/trades.ts` — `getRecent` query
- `convex/users.ts` — `ensureDemoUser` mutation, `getUser` query

Frontend uses `useQuery()` for real-time subscriptions and `useMutation()` for writes. The Convex provider wraps the app in `src/components/providers/convex-provider.tsx`.

## Data Model

```
orders:   { side: "buy"|"sell", price, quantity, filledQuantity, status: "open"|"partial"|"filled"|"cancelled", userId }
trades:   { buyOrderId, sellOrderId, price, quantity, timestamp }
users:    { name, balance }
```

Indexes: `orders.by_side_status` (side, status), `orders.by_user` (userId), `trades.by_timestamp`.

## Matching Engine Rules

- Buy matches sell when `buy.price >= sell.price`
- Match at the **existing** (older) order's price
- Price-time priority: best price first, then earliest `_creationTime`
- Partial fills: fill the smaller quantity, remainder stays open as `"partial"`
- All matching happens inside a single Convex mutation (ACID)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npx convex dev           # first run: creates deployment, generates types, sets NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
npm run dev              # start frontend
```

<!-- convex-ai-start -->
This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.
